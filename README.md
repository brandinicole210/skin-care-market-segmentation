# skin-care-market-segmentation

Principal Component Analysis and K Means Clustering techniques were used to create segmentation for potential consumers of a hypothetical line of skin care products made of all natural ingredients. PCA and K means clustering were coded and executed in SAS before ultimately deciding to use the K Means results, which created four groups with distinct characteristics and values when shopping for a beauty product 1.) anti-aging beauty consumers, 2.) health-conscious consumers, 3.) neutral consumers, and 4.) natural consumers.
